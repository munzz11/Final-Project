# Final-Project

This projet is a simple 2D gravitational field simulation.
When run it simulates and unbounded 2d feild with a variable number of particles on it. The user can create gravity wells by clicking on the window.

The program contains paramters which adjust:
- Stength of the gravity wells created 
- Density of the particles 
- Number of particles being simulated
- Color of the particles
- Max speed of the particles
