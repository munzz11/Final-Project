# Final-Project

This projet is a simple 2D gravitational field simulation.
When run it simulates and unbounded 2d feild with a variable number of particles on it. The user can create gravity wells by clicking on the window.

The program contains paramters which adjust:
- Stength of the graviations wells crated 
- Density of the particles in the simulation
- Number of particles in the simulation
